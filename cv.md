## About Me

Previously, I worked as a book layout designer, gaining experience with Adobe tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. However, I realized I wanted to explore something new and grow in the digital world.

I’ve always loved puzzles, logic games, and creating beautiful things — and frontend development perfectly combines these passions. Just a year ago, I didn’t even know how to create an HTML file. But now, thanks to The Rolling Scopes School, I can build responsive websites and even code simple games.

I genuinely enjoy learning new things, working with details, and watching code transform into something beautiful and functional. It inspires me to keep improving every day.

*This is just the beginning — I'm excited for all the amazing things ahead!*
